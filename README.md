# shinydependentsliders
A solution to creating three linked/dependent sliders

Adapted from several other solutions found around the web

Doesn't account for many edge cases

Tried in a later version to introduce a reset button, which doesn't work (as far as I have been able to figure out so far) due to the behavior of the observers.
